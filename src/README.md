This project contains some useful tools for k-Wave toolbox simulation outputs.

Description
-----------
Three types of tools are implemented and functional:
* **hdf5helper** is HDF5 library wrapper especially designed for k-Wave input and output simulation files
* **k-wave-h5-processing** is command line tool for the k-Wave HDF5 files post-processing.
* **k-wave-h5-visualizer** is gui-based application for visualising of the k-Wave HDF5 files with many features.

Features
--------
Will be updated.

Prerequisites
-------------
* HDF5 library is required (1.8.12+)
* Qt Toolkit in version 5.4x or later for **k-wave-h5-visualizer** is required.
* Cmake or Qt(qmake) is required for building.
