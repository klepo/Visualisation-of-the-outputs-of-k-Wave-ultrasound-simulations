Visualisation of Ultrasound Propagation in Human Body 
=====================
This project contains some useful tools for k-Wave (http://www.k-wave.org) toolbox simulation outputs.
These codes were developed before and then also simultaneously with the on-the-fly 
compression and calculation of time-averaged acoustic Intensity in time-domain 
ultrasound simulations.

Description
-----------
Three types of tools are implemented and functional:
* **k-wave-h5-helper** is HDF5 library wrapper especially designed for k-Wave input and output simulation files
* **k-wave-h5-processing** is command line tool for the k-Wave HDF5 files post-processing.
* **k-wave-h5-visualizer** is gui-based application for visualising of the k-Wave HDF5 files with many features.

Features
--------
Will be updated.

Prerequisites
-------------
* HDF5 library is required (1.8.12+)
* Qt Toolkit version 5.2x or later for **k-wave-h5-visualizer** is required.
* Cmake or Qt (qmake) is required for building.

Examples
--------
Will be updated.

Downloading
